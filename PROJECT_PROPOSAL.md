# PROJECT PROPOSAL: GyanBridge (Enhanced)

## 1) Title
**GyanBridge: A Unified Christ-Centred Intel-Platform with Real-Time Analytics, Legal Intelligence & Localized Multi-Lingual Delivery**

---

## 2) Problem Statement
Global and national Christian leadership lacks a unified digital infrastructure to monitor, analyze, and respond to rapid socio-legal changes. 

**Critical Information Gaps:**
*   **Information Silos:** News regarding missions, persecution, and legal acts is spread across disparate, often inaccessible, sources.
*   **Operational Reactive State:** Without predictive analytics, leadership remains in a reactive mode rather than a proactive strategic state.
*   **Language Barriers:** Most high-quality legal and theological analysis is limited to English, excluding vast sections of the Hindi and Tamil-speaking demographic in India.
*   **Content Saturation:** The overwhelming amount of secular noise makes it difficult to find verified, ministry-relevant content like **Jesus Redeems Ministries**.

---

## 3) Model Name
**Antigravity Multi-Agent Orchestrator (Antigravity v2.5)**
A complex ensemble of:
*   **LLM Core:** GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 for high-reasoning legal and trend synthesis.
*   **Vision Models:** For automated image extraction and visual data normalization.
*   **Scrape-Shield Agents:** Specialized bots designed to bypass session blocks and retrieve live news from 100+ endpoints.

---

## 4) Data & Technical Architecture
GyanBridge is built on a high-performance, real-time data pipeline:

*   **Hybrid RAG Architecture:** Combines a local Vector Database (ChromaDB/SQLite) with **Live Web Context**. Every search query triggers a parallel live-web crawl to ensure the AI's "knowledge" is updated to the current minute.
*   **Dynamic Source Prioritization:** Built-in priority for specific ministry channels (Jesus Redeems, Mohan C Lazarus) ensures institutional voice is never lost in the algorithm.
*   **Advanced Numerical Mining:** A proprietary extraction layer that parses unstructured news snippets into clean time-series data (e.g., converting "several reports of incidents" into a statistical count for graphing).
*   **Cross-Domain Knowledge Base:** 
    *   **Institutional:** Vatican News, CSI, CNI, EFI.
    *   **Legal:** Indiacode.nic.in, Legislative.gov.in (Minority Acts).
    *   **Multimedia:** 24/7 YouTube channel monitoring & RSS ingestion.

## 5) Output Type & Core Capabilities
The platform delivers a premium, high-impact user experience through four distinct modules:

### I. The Intelligence Dashboard (News & Video)
*   **Priority Feed:** Real-time news and video feed where ministry content (JRM) is algorithmically boosted to the top.
*   **Localized UI:** Full support for English, Hindi, and Tamil, including translated titles and summaries.
*   **Reader Mode:** Ad-free, optimized text extraction for distraction-free reading.

### II. Legal Assistant (Constitutional AI)
*   **Verified Legal Guidance:** Step-by-step procedures for property disputes, FCRA compliance, and minority rights.
*   **Evidence-Based:** Every answer is linked to official government PDF acts or legislative URLs.
*   **Multilingual Voice:** Integrated Text-to-Speech support in regional accents.

### III. Strategic Outlook (Trend Analytics)
*   **Predictive Forecasting:** Regression-based 5-year outlooks on community trends and incident reporting.
*   **Historical Mapping:** Visualization of data points over the last 10 years to identify cycles and patterns.
*   **Impact Scoring:** Automatic calculation of "Volatility" and "Trend Factor" for situational awareness.

### IV. Admin Control Room
*   **Content Moderation:** Tools for approving, blocking, or pinning specific news and videos.
*   **Topic Management:** Global switch to refocus the entire platform's scraping engine on specific topics (e.g., shifting from "Global News" to "Science & Technology" with one click).
